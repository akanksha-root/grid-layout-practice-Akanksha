# Grid Layout Practice

Hi, I'm a B.Tech CSE student and this folder is part of my practice for building clean, responsive layouts using CSS Grid.

## What's inside

- `grid_layout.html`: Final layout with proper grid-area assignments, semantic HTML tags, and responsive structure.
- `grid_layout_overlap.html`: A test version where I intentionally overlapped grid items to understand layout behavior and debugging.

## What I practiced

- ✅ CSS Grid layout (rows, columns, grid-template-areas)
- ✅ Semantic HTML tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, etc.)
- ✅ Responsive design basics
- ✅ Overlap testing and layout debugging
- ✅ Clean structure with human-readable comments

## Why I made this

I'm learning how to build recruiter-grade layouts that are clear, minimal, and easy to understand.  
This folder shows both my working version and a test version to document my learning process.

More layout experiments coming soon.
